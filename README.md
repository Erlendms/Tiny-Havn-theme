# Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog
A custom theme for Micro.blog based on the "Tiny" version of write.as. It includes micro.blog specific features and an automatic dark mode (loosely based on Dracula).

### Installation
For now, you can install this theme by adding a new theme in Micro.blog and pasting in the URL to this repository.

### Things to Know
- Currently, the 'about' blurb near the top is hard coded into the files. You can edit `layouts/partials/header.html` to customize it. You will eventually be able to change this in settings.
- You can edit the footer using Micro.blog's custom footer options.
- The theme works with the [Conversation on Micro.blog plugin](https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-conversation-on-mb).
