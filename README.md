Tiny Theme is created and maintained by only me, Matt Langford ([follow on Micro.blog](http://micro.blog/mtt?remote_follow=1)).

## Description
Tiny Theme is developed for use with the Micro.blog platform. It is designed to be as fast as possible while still supporting all features of the platform and popular plugins.

For a working demo and more details, visit [tinyformicro.blog](https://tinyformicro.blog).

## Support Development

Tiny Theme and its plugins are provided free of charge to Micro.blog users. I do not receive payment from Micro.blog in any way. If you'd like to help offset expenses and ensure the future of Tiny Theme and its plugins, please consider supporting its development.
