# Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog
A custom theme for Micro.blog. It includes micro.blog specific features and an automatic dark mode (loosely based on Dracula). It has no additional scripts, no custom fonts, and only 1 media query (for dark mode). It has full support for default comments, the reply by email plugin, and the conversation on Micro.Blog plugin.

### Modifications

#### Adding/Editing the Footer
The Tiny Theme uses Micro.blog's default Custom Footer options. In the Micro.blog "Design" section of your dashboard, click "Edit Footer". Any content added here will show in the footer of your site.

#### Design Changes
To tweak the design, use the "Edit CSS" option in the "Design" section of your Micro.blog dashboard. If you're familiar with CSS, you can dive right in. If not, I'll be adding a few example snippets below soon.
