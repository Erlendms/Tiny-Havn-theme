# Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog

## Introduction
Tiny Theme was created for use with the Micro.blog platform. It is designed to be as fast as possible while still supporting all features of the platform and popular plugins. You can view a working demo [on my personal blog](https://www.mattlangford.com).

## Installation

- Uninstall any theme plugin you currently have
- Set Hugo version to 0.91 (in design settings)
