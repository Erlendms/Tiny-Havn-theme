  <p>
    My name is Erlend (You can pronounce it like the name 'Allen', but with a
    long A-sound - like if it only had one L.), and I live in Oslo, Norway with
    my wife, Kristine, and our dog, Vincent.

  <h2>I started this blog because I needed shelter ...</h2>
  <p>
    ... from the storms in my head. And that's why I named it
    <strong>Havn</strong> (which means <em>harbour</em> in Norwegian).
  </p>
  <p>
    Here I'll try to collect my thoughts, that tend to jolt in every direction
    in search of connections and meaning.
  </p>
  <h2>Sometimes, I make pedal boards,</h2>
  <p>
    and I like to make them <em>nice</em>. That's why I've started a small
    business named "Erlend Mekker Nice", which means "Erlend makes it nice" (it
    a bit broken Norwegian).
  </p>
  <p>I make stuff like this:</p>

    width="600"
    height="337"
    alt="A picture of four different pedal boards for guitar players. I think they're nice, with colour codes and cable management."
  />
  <p>
    So if you know anyone with a duct tape and velcro infested pedal chaos on
    their hands (or feet) - let me know, and I can help! (Especially if it's in
    Norway.)
  </p>
  <h2>I also play in a band!</h2>

  <p>
    It's called <a href="https://www.klondikeband.com/">Klondike</a>, and I've
    also spent some time making our rehearsal room/studio <em>nice</em>!

  <h2>Other than that,</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a teacher, who's worked mostly with teenagers and with the subjects
    maths, music and social science/history. I've also worked with creating math
    curiculum, and I'm currently working on my master's degree in didactic
    mathematics.
