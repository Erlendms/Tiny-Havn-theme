    My name is Erlend (you can pronounce it like the name 'Allen', but with a
    long A-sound - like if it only had one L), and I live in Oslo, Norway with
    my wife, Kristine, and our dog, Vincent.

  <h2>I started this blog because I needed shelter ...</h2>
  <p>
    ... from the storms in my head. And that's why I named it
    <strong>Havn</strong> (which means <em>harbour</em> in Norwegian). Every
    letter is pronounced (the A like the A in "garden"), and it has only one
    syllable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here I'll try to collect my thoughts, that tend to jolt in every direction.
    in search of connections and meaning.
  </p>
  <h3>Here are some of my foundational beliefs:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong
        >We can both buy roses, <em>and</em> accept that they have thorns, and
        deal with the consequences of that. Few things are <em>only good</em> or
        <em>only bad</em>.</strong
      >
      So, some things I'm for can still have bad sides, and some things I'm
      against can have good sides. Our conversations get poorer if we don't
      accept this nuance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >We should be like lumps of clay: Have substance and form, but still be
        malleable.</strong
      >
      But to <em>remain</em> malleable, you have to do an effort to not dry out
      - and you should <em>absolutely</em> refrain from firing yourself to a
      hardened state. I'm wrong about tons of stuff, and should always be open
      to learn more and improve - whether through my own research or other
      people.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >People should be able to love who they love and be who they are</strong
      >, without other people making a big deal out of it. I'm comfortable in
      the gender role I got assigned at birth - but if you're not, and would
      have a better life if you could live in another, I say: "Of course!"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >People should also be allowed to believe in what they believe and still
        be respected.</strong
      >
      (However, that doesn't give them the right to deny others from living as
      who they are - see the last point.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Partly because the context we're born into matters <em>so</em> much (and
      the randomness of that),
      <strong
        >we should levy adequate taxes, particularly from those with more than
        enough, to fund services for all.</strong
      >
      Make the society you'd want if you didn't know what you were born into.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >We <em>need</em> to take more actions to combat climate change</strong
      >
      while still keeping an eye on the environment - as things that help one do
      not necessarily help the other. The wealthiest countries, especially those
      that have polluted a lot historically and/or made lots of money on fossil
      fuels, should lead the charge.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sometimes, I make pedal boards,</h2>
  <p>
    and I like to make them <em>nice</em>. That's why I've started a small
    business named "<a href="https://erlendmekkernice.cool"
      ><strong><em>Erlend Mekker Nice</em></strong></a
    >", which means "Erlend makes it nice" (in a bit broken Norwegian).
  </p>
  <p>I make stuff like this:</p>
  <img
    id="pedalboards"

    width="600"
    height="337"
    alt="A picture of four different pedal boards for guitar players. I think they're nice, with colour codes and cable management."
  />
  <p>
    So if you know anyone with a duct tape and velcro infested pedal chaos on
    their hands (or feet) - let me know, and I can help! (Especially if it's in
    Norway.)
  </p>
  <h2>I also play in a band!</h2>

  <p>
    It's called <a href="https://www.klondikeband.com/">Klondike</a>, and I've
    also spent some time making our rehearsal room/studio <em>nice</em>!

  <h2>Other than that,</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a teacher, who's worked mostly with teenagers and with the subjects
    maths, music and social science/history. I've also worked with creating math
    curiculum, and I'm currently working on my master's degree in didactic
    mathematics. Oh, and I'm one of those who got an ADHD diagnosis as an adult.
