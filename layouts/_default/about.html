  <h2>I started this blog because I needed shelter ...</h2>
  <p>
    ... from the storms in my head. And that's why I named it
    <strong>Havn</strong> (which means <em>harbour</em> in Norwegian).
  </p>
  <p>
    Here I'll try to collect my thoughts, that tend to jolt in every direction
    in search of connections and meaning.
  </p>
  <h2>Sometimes, I make pedal boards,</h2>
  <p>
    and I like to make them <em>nice</em>. That's why I've started a small
    business named "Erlend Mekker Nice", which means "Erlend makes it nice" (it
    a bit broken Norwegian).
  </p>
  <p>I make stuff like this:</p>
  <img
    id="pedalboards"
    src="https://havn.blog/uploads/2024/pedalbrett.jpg"
    width="600"
    height="337"
    alt="A picture of four different pedal boards for guitar players. I think they're nice, with colour codes and cable management."
  />
  <p>
    So if you know anyone with a duct tape and velcro infested pedal chaos on
    their hands (or feet) - let me know, and I can help! (Especially if it's in
    Norway.)
  </p>
  <h2>I also play in a band!</h2>
  <p>
    It's called Klondike, and I think it's a lot of fun. I've also spent some
    time making our rehearsal room/studio <em>nice</em>!
